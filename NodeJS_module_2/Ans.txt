                // que.1 . What is Node.js? Where can you use it?

/*
Node js is an open-source, cross platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser.

Ryan Dahal developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration version 15.14, was released in  April 2021. 

Node.js is commonly used to develop real time applications, also knows as RTAs(REAL TIME APPLICATIONS). Its asy nchrounous event-driven nature allows it to handle heavy input-output oprqations which makes it much esier for node.js developers to achieve the level of perfomance user have come to expect frome modern real time application.

/*
Node. js callbacks are a special type of function passed as an argument to another function. They're called when the function that contains the callback as an argument completes its execution, and allows the code in the callback to run in the meantime. Callbacks help us make asynchronous calls.
