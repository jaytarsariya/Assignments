    what is oop?
    ________________
    oop is an object orianted program.

    c++ is devleped by bjerne stroutup at at & t's bell leboratory in 1979.

 =>    procedural programming is about writing procedures or that    perform oprations on the data, while object oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

    object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

    1. oop is faster and easier to exwcute.
    2. oop provides a clear structure for the programs.
    3. oop helps to keep the c++ code   dry "don't repeat yourself", and mack the code easier to maintain, modyfy and debug.
    4. oop makes it possible ti creat full reusable application with less code and shorter development time.

               before starting to learn c++ it is essential to have a basic knowledge of the concepts of object oriented programming.

               some of the important object oriented features are namely:

               1.   objects
               2.   classes
               3.   inheritance
               4.   data abstraction
               5.   data encapsulation
               6.   polymorphysm
               7.   overloading
               8.   reusability
